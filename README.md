# Quantum Honkibilia

Quantum Honkibilia will (probably not) be a platformer game. It'll probably have a daring amount of achievements, terrible pixel art, unfitting music, and unintuitive controls. Please do not get excited. Thanks!

Neither "quantum" nor "honkibilia" mean anything at the moment, but once the game starts being made (if ever) and we make a story, we'll probably give them some unsatisfactory meaning.

The [Rectanculous Renderorus editor](https://orbiit.github.io/quantum-honkibilia/rectanculous-renderorus.html) is a mouse-only unintuitive editor meant only for developers of Quantum Honkibilia. It utilizes a lot of keyboard shortcuts as follows:

## Editing mode

The grid will be shown while in this mode. You can switch to the non-editing mode by pressing `space`.

You can move around the grid using the `WASD` keys (left, up, right, and down respectively). Scroll to zoom in/out.

Click and drag on the grid to create a new rectangle; dragging sets its size, which cannot be changed after its creation.

Use the `[` and `]` keys to cycle between the different block types.

Click on existing blocks (or the player) to move them around. User-created blocks can be deleted by selecting them and pressing `backspace` or `delete`. There is no undo functionality.

## Non-editing mode

Likewise, you can return to editing using `space`. This mode is on by default.

`WAD` moves the player; `A` and `D` for horizontal movement, and `W` to jump (standard Scratch platformer WASD controls). `R` to suicide.

You can still scroll in/out while in this mode.

## Codes

Level codes are stored in the URL, so if you haven't turned off browsing history, if you accidentally lose the tab, you might be able to recover it in history. The URL can be shared with other individuals.
